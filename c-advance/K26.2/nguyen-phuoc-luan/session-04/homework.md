## Exercise_1 [build]

### Problem Statement

**Polymorphic Display Driver**

**Scenario:**
You are building an embedded system that needs to draw to a display. We want to achieve two core Object-Oriented principles in C:
1. **Encapsulation**: Hide the internal configuration data of the display driver using **Opaque Pointers** (which is just a common name for a forward-declared incomplete struct) so the application cannot tamper with it.
2. **Polymorphism**: Decouple our drawing logic from the exact hardware using a Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) built with structs of function pointers.

**Requirements:**
Write a C program that implements an encapsulated, polymorphic display driver:
1. Define a forward-declared opaque pointer (an incomplete struct used to hide data) `typedef struct display_config_s display_config_t;` in your header to hide the configuration data.
2. Define an interface `i_display_t` (a struct) with two function pointers:
   - `void (*init)(display_config_t *config);`
   - `void (*draw_pixel)(uint16_t x, uint16_t y, uint8_t color);`
3. Create two concrete implementations:
   - **Console Display**: `console_display_init()` and `console_display_draw_pixel()`. The `init` function must cast the opaque pointer back to its concrete struct (which you define inside `console_display.c`). The `draw_pixel()` function is basically just a `printf` log to the terminal (e.g. `[Console] Drawing pixel at (x,y) with color C`), simulating drawing on a screen.
   - **Dummy Display (Mock)**: `dummy_display_init()` and `dummy_display_draw_pixel()`. *Why do we need a dummy display?* In real-world embedded development, you often have to write application code before the physical hardware (like an OLED screen) is ready. A "dummy" or "mock" function safely does nothing but allows you to test your application logic without crashing. Here, `dummy_display_draw_pixel()` should just increment a static global counter `dummy_draw_count` so we can verify our logic called it the correct number of times.
4. Provide a factory function `display_config_t* console_config_create(uint32_t baud_rate)` that statically or dynamically allocates the config and returns the opaque pointer.
5. Create a global instance of `i_display_t` for both the console and the dummy display.
6. Write an application function `void draw_rectangle(i_display_t *disp)` that uses the interface to "draw" a 2x2 rectangle (4 pixels total) starting at (0,0). Since drawing is just printing logs, calling this function will result in 4 `printf` logs.
7. In `main()`, obtain the opaque config pointer, pass it to the console display's `init`, call `draw_rectangle`, and repeat for the dummy display. Print the `dummy_draw_count` at the end to prove it was called 4 times.

**Rules:**
- Check for `NULL` function pointers defensively before calling them.
- Use `cppcheck` and `clang-tidy` to analyze, and make sure there are no warning or error messages.
- Follow BARR-C coding style (fixed-width integers, mandatory braces, pointer naming with `p_` prefix).
- **Code Documentation:** All functions and data structures MUST be fully documented using Doxygen-style comments.
- Compile with strict flags: `-Wall -Wextra -pedantic -Werror -std=c99`.

### Coding Standards Reference

**MISRA-C 2012 (Safety):**
| Rule | Category | Relevance to This Exercise |
|---|---|---|
| Directive 4.8 | Advisory | If a pointer to a structure or union is never dereferenced within a translation unit, then the implementation of the object should be hidden → Enforces the use of opaque pointers for data hiding. |
| Directive 4.11 | Required | The validity of values passed to library functions shall be checked → validate `disp` and its function pointers for `NULL` before use. |
| Rule 11.3 | Required | A cast shall not be performed between a pointer to object type and a pointer to a different object type → Ensure function pointer signatures match exactly to avoid undefined behavior. |
| Rule 15.6 | Required | The body of an iteration-statement or a selection-statement shall be a compound-statement → Mandatory braces for the `NULL` checks. |

**CERT-C 2016 (Security):**
| Rule | Relevance to This Exercise |
|---|---|
| EXP34-C | Do not dereference null pointers → Extremely critical for function pointers in structs. Validate before calling. |

> **How to use:** Open the MISRA-C 2012 and CERT-C 2016 PDFs (under `C_Books/`) and read the full description of each rule above. After writing your code, verify your implementation follows these rules.

### Design Hints (optional)

**Suggested file structure:**
```
Exercise_1/
├── i_display.h          ← HAL interface + opaque pointer (shared by all)
├── console_display.h    ← factory function + extern driver instance
├── console_display.c    ← concrete struct definition + implementation
├── dummy_display.h      ← extern driver instance + call counter
├── dummy_display.c      ← mock implementation
├── main.c               ← application logic only
└── Makefile
```

**Key steps:**

1. In `i_display.h`, forward-declare the opaque type and define the interface:
```c
typedef struct display_config_s display_config_t; /* incomplete type — data hiding */

typedef struct i_display_s {
    void (*init)(display_config_t *p_config);
    void (*draw_pixel)(uint16_t x, uint16_t y, uint8_t color);
} i_display_t;
```

2. In `console_display.c` **only**, write the full `struct display_config_s { ... };` definition. This is what makes the data truly hidden — any other `.c` that tries to access a field will get a compiler error.

3. Provide a factory function that statically allocates the config and returns the opaque handle:
```c
/* console_display.h */
display_config_t *console_config_create(uint32_t baud_rate);
extern i_display_t console_display;
```

4. In `main.c`, you hold a `display_config_t *` pointer but the compiler will refuse to let you access any fields — that is the encapsulation at work. Try it: add `p_cfg->baud_rate` and see what the compiler says!

5. `draw_rectangle()` in `main.c` must accept only `i_display_t *` — it must not know anything about the concrete driver behind it.

### Acceptance Criteria (Scoring)
- **[20%]** Code builds successfully without warnings or errors.
- **[20%]** Code passes static analysis (`cppcheck`, `clang-tidy`).
- **[20%]** Code contains required Doxygen documentation.
- **[40%]** Logic correctly implements polymorphism and encapsulation (opaque pointers), and the output matches the expected output exactly.

### Expected Output

```
[Console] Drawing pixel at (0,0) with color 1
[Console] Drawing pixel at (1,0) with color 1
[Console] Drawing pixel at (0,1) with color 1
[Console] Drawing pixel at (1,1) with color 1
Dummy display was called 4 times.
```
Exit code: `0`

## Exercise_2 [build]

### Problem Statement

**The Object Pool Allocator**

**Scenario:**
Dynamic memory allocation (`malloc`/`free`) is forbidden in many safety-critical embedded systems due to fragmentation and non-deterministic execution time. Instead, we use Object Pools (block allocators) to manage statically allocated memory at runtime.

> 💡 **Why is this "Memory Optimization"?**
> When you write `static network_packet_t s_pool[5];`, the compiler places the entire pool array in the **`.bss`** section (zero-initialized static storage) — not on the Stack and not on the Heap.
> This means:
> - **Size is fixed at compile time** → the linker knows exactly how much RAM is needed before the firmware runs. No surprises at runtime.
> - **No fragmentation** → you always hand out fixed-size objects, so holes can never form.
> - **O(1) worst-case allocation** → scanning 5 slots is deterministic; `malloc` is not.
> - **Lives in RAM, costs zero Flash** → static variables in `.bss` are zero-initialised by the startup code, so no initial values need to be stored in Flash.
>
> This is exactly how **LwIP**, **FreeRTOS**, and **AUTOSAR** manage their internal objects.

**Requirements:**
Write a generic Object Pool manager in C to manage network packets.
1. Define a `network_packet_t` struct containing a `uint32_t id` and a `uint8_t payload[64]`.
2. Statically allocate an array of exactly **5** `network_packet_t` structs (the pool), and a boolean array `bool packet_in_use[5]` to track which packets are allocated.
3. Implement `network_packet_t* packet_alloc(void)` which searches for the first available packet, marks it as in-use, and returns its pointer. If the pool is full, it must return `NULL`.
4. Implement `void packet_free(network_packet_t *p_packet)` which marks the given packet as available again. Ensure it handles `NULL` pointers gracefully and validates that the pointer actually belongs to the pool.
5. In `main()`, write a test that:
   - Allocates 5 packets successfully.
   - Attempts to allocate a 6th packet and proves it fails (returns `NULL`).
   - Frees one packet.
   - Allocates a new packet and proves it succeeds.

**Rules:**
- **No dynamic memory allocation (`malloc`, `calloc`, `free`) is allowed.**
- Check for `NULL` pointers defensively.
- Ensure pointer arithmetic or array bounds are strictly respected.
- Use `cppcheck` and `clang-tidy` to analyze, and make sure there are no warning or error messages.
- Follow BARR-C coding style (fixed-width integers, mandatory braces, pointer naming with `p_` prefix).
- **Code Documentation:** All functions and data structures MUST be fully documented using Doxygen-style comments.
- Compile with strict flags: `-Wall -Wextra -pedantic -Werror -std=c99`.

### Coding Standards Reference

**MISRA-C 2012 (Safety):**
| Rule | Category | Relevance to This Exercise |
|---|---|---|
| Directive 4.12 | Required | Dynamic memory allocation shall not be used → The core principle of this exercise. |
| Rule 9.1 | Mandatory | The value of an object with automatic storage duration shall not be read before it has been set → Ensure the `packet_in_use` array is properly zero-initialized before use. |
| Rule 14.2 | Required | A `for` loop shall be well-formed → Iterating over the pool array must use deterministic bounds (`0` to `4`). |
| Rule 18.1 | Required | A pointer resulting from arithmetic on a pointer operand shall address an element of the same array → Validating that `p_packet` passed to `packet_free` is within the statically allocated pool array. |

**CERT-C 2016 (Security):**
| Rule | Relevance to This Exercise |
|---|---|
| EXP34-C | Do not dereference null pointers → Validate the pointer returned by `packet_alloc` before using it. |
| ARR30-C | Do not form or use out-of-bounds pointers or array subscripts → Ensure `packet_in_use[i]` strictly bounds checks `i < 5`. |

> **How to use:** Open the MISRA-C 2012 and CERT-C 2016 PDFs (under `C_Books/`) and read the full description of each rule above. After writing your code, verify your implementation follows these rules.

### Design Hints (optional)

#define POOL_SIZE 5

typedef struct {
    uint32_t id;
    uint8_t payload[64];
} network_packet_t;

/**

 */
void pool_init(void);

/**
 * @brief Allocate a packet from the pool.
 * @return Pointer to packet, or NULL if pool is full.
 */
network_packet_t* packet_alloc(void);

/**
 * @brief Free a packet back to the pool.

- **[20%]** Code passes static analysis (`cppcheck`, `clang-tidy`).
- **[20%]** Code contains required Doxygen documentation.
- **[40%]** Logic correctly handles full pool condition (returns NULL) and correctly frees packets.

### Expected Output

```
Allocating packet 1: Success

Allocating packet 3: Success
Allocating packet 4: Success
Allocating packet 5: Success
Allocating packet 6: Failed (Pool Full)

## Exercise_2 — Part B [review-only]

### Problem Statement

**Memory Layout Inspection**

After successfully building your `exercise_2` binary, run the following command and answer the questions below:

```bash
size exercise_2
```

You should see output like:
```
   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
   XXXX       X     YYY    ZZZZ    ZZZZ exercise_2
```

**Questions (write your answers as comments at the top of your `main.c`):**

1. Look at the **`bss`** value. The pool array `s_pool[5]` and `s_in_use[5]` are both `static` variables with no explicit initialiser. Which memory section do they live in (`.text`, `.data`, or `.bss`) and why?

2. If you changed the pool declaration to initialise it explicitly:
   ```c
   static network_packet_t s_pool[5] = {0};
   ```
   Would it move from `.bss` to `.data`? Why or why not? *(Hint: the C standard says zero-initialised static storage is equivalent to uninitialized static storage.)*

3. The `packet_alloc()` and `packet_free()` function bodies (compiled machine code) live in which memory section? On a real MCU with 64KB Flash and 16KB RAM, where would each section physically reside?

4. If `POOL_SIZE` was increased from `5` to `50`, which section grows and by how much? Calculate the expected new `.bss` size in bytes, given `sizeof(network_packet_t) = 68` bytes.

### Acceptance Criteria (Part B)
- **[25%]** Correct identification of `.bss` for the pool array with a clear justification.
- **[25%]** Correct explanation of zero-init equivalence (`.bss` vs `.data`).
- **[25%]** Correct mapping of function code to `.text`, and Flash/RAM mapping for a real MCU.
- **[25%]** Correct `.bss` growth calculation for `POOL_SIZE = 50`.

## Exercise_3 [build]

### Problem Statement

**Endian-Safe Protocol Parser**

**Scenario:**
You are writing firmware for a Little-Endian ARM Cortex-M4 microcontroller. It receives a 6-byte raw data payload from an external sensor over SPI. The sensor transmits data in **Big-Endian (Network Byte Order)** format.

The payload format is:
- Bytes 0-1: `temperature` (16-bit unsigned integer)
- Bytes 2-5: `timestamp` (32-bit unsigned integer)

**Requirements:**
Write a C program that parses this raw byte array into a C struct safely, regardless of the host CPU's endianness.
1. Define a struct `sensor_data_t` containing `uint16_t temperature` and `uint32_t timestamp`.
2. Write a parsing function `void parse_sensor_data(const uint8_t *p_buffer, sensor_data_t *p_out_data)`.
3. In `main()`, simulate receiving the raw buffer: `{0x01, 0x2C, 0x00, 0x00, 0x1A, 0x0A}`.
4. Pass this buffer to your parsing function.
5. Print the resulting integer values in decimal to verify they are correct.

**Rules:**
- **Strict aliasing rules apply**: You are NOT allowed to cast the `uint8_t*` buffer to a `uint16_t*` or `uint32_t*`. This is strictly forbidden as it causes Unaligned Memory Access hardware faults.
- You must use **bitwise shifts (`<<`, `>>`) and bitwise OR (`|`)** to reconstruct the integers byte-by-byte. This guarantees endian-safe execution.
- Check for `NULL` pointers defensively.
- Use `cppcheck` and `clang-tidy` to analyze, and make sure there are no warning or error messages.
- Follow BARR-C coding style.
- **Code Documentation:** All functions and data structures MUST be fully documented using Doxygen-style comments.
- Compile with strict flags: `-Wall -Wextra -pedantic -Werror -std=c99`.

### Coding Standards Reference

**MISRA-C 2012 (Safety):**
| Rule | Category | Relevance to This Exercise |
|---|---|---|
| Rule 10.3 | Required | The value of an expression shall not be assigned to an object with a narrower essential type → Be careful when applying bitwise shifts to `uint8_t` values; cast to `uint32_t` before shifting by 24. |
| Rule 11.3 | Required | A cast shall not be performed between a pointer to object type and a pointer to a different object type → Prohibits unsafe casting of `uint8_t*` to `uint32_t*`. |
| Rule 11.4 | Advisory | A conversion should not be performed between a pointer to object and an integer type → Use bitwise math instead of memory tricks. |

**CERT-C 2016 (Security):**
| Rule | Relevance to This Exercise |
|---|---|
| EXP34-C | Do not dereference null pointers → Validate `p_buffer` and `p_out_data`. |
| INT31-C | Ensure that integer conversions do not result in lost or misinterpreted data → When shifting bytes into a 32-bit integer, ensure implicit integer promotion does not result in sign-extension bugs. |
